Responsive Web Design
Mobile devices are an important part of everyday life, especially since consumers spend more than five hours a day on their smartphone. People want to be able to browse the internet and access the information they need from their favorite devices without any headaches or second-guessing. Responsive web design automatically adapts a web store to the mobile device that’s being used without distorting the view.
Attractive, Easy-to-Navigate Web Store Design
Attraction equals persuasion. A good-looking online store supports customers throughout each step of the buying journey: from enticing a shopper to visit the webpage, to inspiring them to explore the store and its products, to finally charming them into purchasing.
Product Details
Online shopping can be a leap of faith — a shopper can’t physically pick up and feel merchandise before they buy, like they would in a brick-and-mortar store. In fact, a study found that 62% of shoppers choose brick-and-mortar stores over online options solely because they want to be able to see, touch, and feel the product.
Search and Filter
Some customers know precisely what they’re looking for — which is why it’s important to provide them with a focused shopping approach with searching and filtering functionality. A search bar or box helps customers instantly locate what they need. According to Marketing Charts, 35% of visitors to an ecommerce site always use the site search box.
Customer Reviews
Shoppers want to hear from real people about their product experiences to see if the product fits their desires and expectations. According to Kissmetrics, 55% of shoppers say that online reviews influence their buying decision. Build trust with your shoppers by posting customer product reviews on your site. And while positive reviews are helpful, don’t be afraid to post negative reviews, too — your transparency creates credibility on the honesty of your brand.
Powerful Shopping Cart
A shopping cart isn’t just a place for customers to store items pending checkout — it’s another important touchpoint that can deliver additional conversion opportunities. Cross-selling at checkout helps target customers more precisely with products they are likely to be interested in based on the items already in their cart — which can in turn increase the purchase total.
Total visibility into the products awaiting purchase and their costs (including shipping and sales tax) keeps customers aware and decreases the likelihood of abandonment.
Simple Checkout
Don’t let a complicated or lengthy checkout process make customers abandon their shopping cart at the last minute. Eliminate friction with an easy checkout that allows customers to quickly fill out only the most necessary information. Fields that the customers can fill out by choice on the form (such as signing up for a newsletter); pre-filling forms; a progress bar for multiple steps/pages; and the ability to store credit card information for repeat shoppers helps to minimize frustration.
